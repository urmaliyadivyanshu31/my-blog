            `Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to use JavaScript on the server-side to build fast and scalable network applications. Node.js is designed to handle a large number of connections and is optimized for real-time applications such as chat applications, online games, and streaming services. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it efficient in handling real-time data and makes it easy to scale applications horizontally by adding more resources. Node.js has a large and active community that has produced a vast library of packages and modules, called npm, which can be easily installed and used in applications, making development quicker and easier. It is widely used by companies such as Netflix, PayPal, and Walmart for building their web applications.`

            `MongoDB is a popular, open-source NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model to store data. This means that data is stored as a collection of documents, rather than as a collection of rows in a table. MongoDB is designed to handle large amounts of data, with high scalability and performance. It also offers features such as automatic sharding for horizontal scaling, and replica sets for high availability. Additionally, MongoDB supports a wide range of programming languages and is easy to use, making it a popular choice for many modern web applications.`,

            `JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language that is widely used for building web applications and adding interactivity to websites. It is primarily used on the client-side, but can also be run on the server-side with technologies like Node.js. JavaScript is known for its versatility and can be used to perform tasks ranging from basic form validation to complex single-page applications and real-time communication. The syntax of JavaScript is influenced by programming languages like C and Java, making it easy for programmers to learn. JavaScript is supported by all major browsers and is an essential part of the web development stack.
